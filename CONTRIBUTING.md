# Contributing

## Branching Strategy

We follow a strategy pretty similar to [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
Feature branches should be based on master and merged back to master once the feature is finalized.

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables/configurations, useful file locations and container parameters.
1. Update the CHANGELOG.md with a short excerpt about your changes in the Unreleased section at the top. 
1. Version numbers will be updated as part of the release process once PR is merged back up. UNLESS you need to explicitly increase the major or minor version beyond what is currently in the master branch. 
1. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of one other developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer merge it for you.
1. Merge commits are disallowed. [Other merge methods](https://help.github.com/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/).
